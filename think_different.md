##### I am differentiating for all learners (UDL) to access and participate in learning opportunities through representation, engagement and reflection.
##### Multiple means of representation:  key information is through different modalities
1. lecture or direct instruction can be accessed  before it’s taught in class through videos/texts (flipped classroom)
2. graphic organizers for students to “translate” programs into pseudocode (whiteboard)
3. unplugged physical representations; teacher models the content; videos teach/reinforce the same content; anchor charts/reference tables provide visual and text reminders; translations in Spanish and Arabic
##### Engagement:  offer choices in how learning objective can be reached and in the tools or supports available
1. Students can choose the tough, tougher or toughest assignment;   assignments should be relevant to student’s culture and age;  
2. Allow for differences in pacing/additional time to complete the tasks  (per ELLs, SwDs or other needs)
3. Students can work independently, in pairs, groups of four or small group instruction with the teacher
4. Extensions/challenges for advanced learners
##### Learner Reflection:  students reflect on their choices, learning progress and work quality compared to the rubrics/exemplars/learning objectives
1. Students answer:  what have I learned; what do I need to work on; what do I need to do to master the material
2. Students can set SMART learning goals
3. Offer tutorial; opportunities for revisions
